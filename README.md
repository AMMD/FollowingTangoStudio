FollowingTangoStudio
====================

TangoStudio was a ubuntu-based distribution which goals were audio production mostly, and video/image production. The development of TangoStudio as is is now stopped (though working isos are shipped on the original website). FollowingTangoStudio is a project lead by some of the TangoStudio users/contributors to keep it going, based on Debian, and as much as possible integrating Debian as a blend.
